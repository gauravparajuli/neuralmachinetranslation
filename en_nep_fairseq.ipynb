Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a single dash (-) are ignored. wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and?. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu. However, these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name, so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a. b. cs. foo. edu. IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/ netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either ` / 255.255.252.0 'or ` / 22' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).\n",

The host may be specified in a number of ways: single host This is the most common format. You may specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized by the resolver, the fully qualified domain name, or an IP address. netgroups NIS netgroups may be given as @group. Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a single dash (-) are ignored. wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and?. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu. However, these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name, so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a. b. cs. foo. edu. IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/ netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either ` / 255.255.252.0 'or ` / 22' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).\n",

You may specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized by the resolver, the fully qualified domain name, or an IP address. netgroups NIS netgroups may be given as @group. Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a single dash (-) are ignored. wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and?. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu. However, these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name, so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a. b. cs. foo. edu. IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/ netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either ` / 255.255.252.0 'or ` / 22' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).\n",

Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership.

This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu.

You may specify a host either by an abbreviated name recognized by the resolver, the fully qualified domain name, or an IP address. netgroups NIS netgroups may be given as @group. Only the host part of each netgroup members is consider in checking for membership. Empty host parts or those containing a single dash (-) are ignored. wildcards Machine names may contain the wildcard characters * and?. This can be used to make the exports file more compact; for instance, *. cs. foo. edu matches all hosts in the domain cs. foo. edu. However, these wildcard characters do not match the dots in a domain name, so the above pattern does not include hosts such as a. b. cs. foo. edu. IP networks You can also export directories to all hosts on an IP (sub-) network simultaneously. This is done by specifying an IP address and netmask pair as address/ netmask where the netmask can be specified in dotted-decimal format, or as a contiguous mask length (for example, either ` / 255.255.252.0 'or ` / 22' appended to the network base address result in identical subnetworks with 10 bits of host).\n",
